Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am Bello Soliu, a resourceful Web Developer

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mern stack projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Redux, TypeScript and AWS Services.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mern stack or Django projects
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Node and Databases
- ğŸ“« Check my portfolio link <a href="https://techflow21.github.io/sobportfolio/">Here</a>
- âš¡ Fun fact: Whenever I feel exhausted while coding, I go eat good food and relax.
